# DifferentiableSVD

This repository contains:
1. The official implementation of the ICCV21 paper [Why Approximate Matrix Square Root Outperforms Accurate SVD in Global Covariance Pooling?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02498)
2. A collection of differentiable SVD methods.

## Differentiable SVD methods

## Training on ImageNet

## Finetuning on FGVC

Codes will be updated very soon.
